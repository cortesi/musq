//! Provides the connection pool for asynchronous connections.

//!
//! A connection pool is a standard technique that can manage opening and re-using connections.
//! Normally it also enforces a maximum number of connections as these are an expensive resource,
//! even when working with SQLite.

/// An asynchronous pool of database connections.
///
/// The `Pool` is the main entry point for interacting with a SQLite database. It manages a set
/// of connections, allowing multiple asynchronous tasks to execute queries concurrently.
///
/// For most use cases, you can execute queries directly on a shared reference to the pool (`&Pool`).
/// This is ideal for stateless, one-off queries, as the pool will handle acquiring and releasing
/// a connection for you.
///
/// The `Pool` is `Send`, `Sync`, and cheap to clone. It should be created once when your
/// application starts and then shared across all tasks.
///
/// ## Transactions
///
/// To run a series of queries within a transaction, call [`pool.begin()`][Pool::begin] to acquire
/// a [`Transaction`] object. All operations on the `Transaction` object are guaranteed to run
/// on the same underlying connection.
///
/// ## Connection-Specific State
///
/// In rare cases, you may need to run a series of non-transactional queries that rely on
/// connection-specific state, such as temporary tables. For these scenarios, you can manually
/// acquire a [`PoolConnection`] from the pool using [`pool.acquire()`][Pool::acquire].
///
/// See [`PoolConnection`] for more details on this advanced use case.
