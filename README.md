<h1 align="center">muSQLite</h1>

muSQLite is an async SQLite crate library for Rust.

<h3> Why? </h3>

muSQLite started as a fork of sqlx, focused just on SQLite. The aims are to simplify and clean up the codebase, strip
out un-needed features, add features, improve testing and ergonomics, and support WASM.
