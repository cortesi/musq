SQLx is an async, pure Rust<sub>â€ </sub> SQL crate featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL.

-   **Truly Asynchronous**. Built from the ground-up using async/await for maximum concurrency.

<small><small>

---

-   Cross-platform. Being native Rust, SQLx will compile anywhere Rust is supported.

-   Built-in connection pooling with `sqlx::Pool`.

-   Row streaming. Data is read asynchronously from the database and decoded on demand.

-   Automatic statement preparation and caching. When using the high-level query API (`sqlx::query`), statements are
    prepared and cached per connection.

-   Simple (unprepared) query execution including fetching results into the same `Row` types used by
    the high-level API. Supports batch execution and returns results from all statements.

-   Nested transactions with support for save points.

## Usage

### Querying

In SQL, queries can be separated into prepared (parameterized) or unprepared (simple). Prepared queries have their
query plan _cached_, use a binary mode of communication (lower bandwidth and faster decoding), and utilize parameters
to avoid SQL injection. Unprepared queries are simple and intended only for use where a prepared statement
will not work, such as various database commands (e.g., `PRAGMA` or `SET` or `BEGIN`).

SQLx supports all operations with both types of queries. In SQLx, a `&str` is treated as an unprepared query,
and a `Query` or `QueryAs` struct is treated as a prepared query.

```rust
// low-level, Executor trait
conn.execute("BEGIN").await?; // unprepared, simple query
conn.execute(sqlx::query("DELETE FROM table")).await?; // prepared, cached query
```

We should prefer to use the high-level `query` interface whenever possible. To make this easier, there are finalizers
on the type to avoid the need to wrap with an executor.

```rust
sqlx::query("DELETE FROM table").execute(&mut conn).await?;
sqlx::query("DELETE FROM table").execute(&pool).await?;
```

The `execute` query finalizer returns the number of affected rows, if any, and drops all received results.
In addition, there are `fetch`, `fetch_one`, `fetch_optional`, and `fetch_all` to receive results.

The `Query` type returned from `sqlx::query` will return `Row<'conn>` from the database. Column values can be accessed
by ordinal or by name with `row.get()`. As the `Row` retains an immutable borrow on the connection, only one
`Row` may exist at a time.

The `fetch` query finalizer returns a stream-like type that iterates through the rows in the result sets.

```rust
// provides `try_next`
use futures::TryStreamExt;

let mut rows = sqlx::query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?")
    .bind(email)
    .fetch(&mut conn);

while let Some(row) = rows.try_next().await? {
    // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    let email: &str = row.try_get("email")?;
}
```

To assist with mapping the row into a domain type, one of two idioms may be used:

```rust
let mut stream = sqlx::query("SELECT * FROM users")
    .map(|row: PgRow| {
        // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    })
    .fetch(&mut conn);
```

```rust
#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct User { name: String, id: i64 }

let mut stream = sqlx::query_as::<_, User>("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? OR name = ?")
    .bind(user_email)
    .bind(user_name)
    .fetch(&mut conn);
```

Instead of a stream of results, we can use `fetch_one` or `fetch_optional` to request one required or optional result
from the database.
